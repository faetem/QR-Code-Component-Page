## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that when flex items are not centering it's probably due to the page dimensions. 

```css
body {
    ...
    height: 100vh; 
    margin: 0; /*removes scrollbar*/
}
```
Without these two lines, the content is not at the center of the page and a right scrollbar appears.

Also, I tried using some media query for responsiveness but I deemed it unecessary since it the doesn't really change the page in mobile dimesions. When I tried implementing it, it didn't work at first and I learned that it was because you are suppose to write media queries at the bottom of the CSS file (for it to not overlap with the rest of the styling).

### Continued development

I will probably use this page to implement fun and interesting things I learn in web development. Next step will probably be to add some JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://www.chatgpt.com) - Helped me figure out why the container was not centering in the body (turned out it was because of the height) and why my attempted media query was not working.
